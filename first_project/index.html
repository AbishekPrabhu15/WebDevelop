    <p>Across India, the citizens are devoted to worshipping numerous gods and goddesses from Hinduism, engaging in festivities to celebrate them and their power. One man from the state of Madhya Pradesh is a devotee not of the beloved gods but of a very opposite entity – the Ravana.
        As per the reports of Local18, the man is named Ramprasad Ahirwar, an elderly retired teacher of 80 years and a resident of Chhatarpur. He is popular for building a temple for Ravana; a deity he worships throughout the year, without fail. The statue of the deity at Ramprasad’s temple has its infamous ten heads but is sculpted with a smiling face as if blessing a devotee.
        He stated, “After returning from Gaya in Bihar, I got the idea of building a temple of Ravana at home. This temple was built in the year 2017.” According to him, he read about Ravana and started to like him. He believes that Ravana is not a bad entity. So, Ramprasad was extremely impressed with him, so much so, that he ended up building a temple in his name and, worships it diligently.
        Ramprasad believes Ravana was a brave, mighty and intelligent man and was a peace-loving king. The latter is one of the major reasons, the man decided to worship Ravana. In his early days, he disliked violence, the elderly man added.
        Ramprasad Ahirwar is a retired government teacher and only in a few years has his faith towards Ravana increased so much, that he decided to build a temple.</p>
